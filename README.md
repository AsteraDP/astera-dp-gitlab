Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

```shell
- hosts: gitlab
  become: true
  roles:
    - role: gitlab
```

Example run:
```shell
ansible-playbook task2.yml -i hosts.ini -u username --private-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa_private_key
```
